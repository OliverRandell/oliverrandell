            <p>With 7 years of experience as a Senior Product Manager, I am currently managing product solutions for a brand management software company. My unique combination of frontend engineering and UX design expertise enables me to effectively handle both stakeholder management and technical discussions.</p>
            <p>I graduated from university with a 2:1 in Motorsports Engineering and started as a race-car engineer. However, my interest in technology and design led me to transition into web design and development.</p>
            <p>I taught myself Photoshop and HTML & CSS using resources like Sitepoint. The joy I experience in designing and creating is unparalleled and has greatly influenced my career path.</p>
            <p>Over time, I've grown into a managerial role. I bring my technical, managerial, and creative skills to my current position, acting as a unifying force within the product team and ensuring high-quality output.</p>
            <p>As I pursue further professional growth, I am seeking new challenges in a progressive organization. I am enthusiastic about applying my skills and experience in novel ways and contributing to an environment that values innovation and collaboration.</p>
